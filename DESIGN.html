  <p>
The development of the manta ray-inspired robotic model was a multidisciplinary process, integrating advanced design tools, workshop technologies, and digital fabrication techniques. 
The objective was to create a lifelike prototype that reflected both the aesthetics and functional motion of a real manta ray. 
To achieve this, our team leveraged a wide range of resources provided through university facilities, combining scanning, modelling, simulation, printing, and post-processing techniques.
Each phase of the design and build process relied on specialised tools and methods to ensure high precision and realism. 
Below is a comprehensive overview of the key technologies and resources that contributed to the success of this project.  </p>
  <ol>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>3D Scanning Hardware, Software, and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
We began the development process by using high-resolution 3D scanning hardware and software to capture accurate anatomical references. 
Rather than working solely from images or sketches, we scanned real fish models to gather detailed surface information — especially the natural textures and contours of the skin. 
This allowed us to extract realistic features, such as the unique ripple patterns and organic curves of a manta ray, which were directly applied to our 3D model.
The scanning process was conducted in dedicated scanning environments within the university’s workshop, where proper lighting and stability helped reduce distortions and ensured reliable mesh data. The results were used not only for shape reference but also to guide the sculpting and digital design phases.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>Motion Capture Hardware, Software, and Stage Facilities:</strong><br>
To replicate the smooth, flowing motion of manta ray fins, we used motion capture technology. The system helped us study and analyse the kinematics of fin-like movements by capturing data from staged demonstrations. 
With motion capture sensors attached to simulated fin models, we were able to observe how flexible materials behaved when mimicking underwater movement.
The motion data collected from this process informed the articulation design and inspired the movement mechanism in our robotic manta ray. 
Although we didn’t use the data directly for animation, it provided valuable insights into natural motion paths and realistic movement patterns, which we applied in both the design and control planning of the final prototype.    </li>
   
	  <li>
      <strong>3D Modelling Software:ON-SHAPE:</strong><br>
For the modelling and design process, we used Onshape, a cloud-based 3D modelling platform, to digitally build the entire structure of the manta ray. 
Onshape allowed for collaborative work and flexible parametric modelling, which made it easy to test variations, refine details, and adapt designs across the team.
The manta ray body was designed as a hollow shell to reduce weight and facilitate internal mounting. 
The pectoral fins were designed as segmented extensions to enable flexibility, allowing natural-looking articulation once assembled. 
Instead of using traditional mechanical joints, the fin design was 3D printed with built-in flexibility and connected using fishing thread for motion. 
The internal structure was also modelled to support servo motor placement and to secure the connections needed for controlled movement.    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Haptic Input Hardware and 3D Sculpting Software:</strong><br>
To refine the outer shape of the manta ray and add organic realism, we utilized haptic input devices along with 3D sculpting software. 
These tools allowed us to physically "feel" and sculpt the virtual surfaces, improving accuracy in replicating natural forms like curves, bulges, and transitions between body sections.
This approach was especially useful when working on the outer body shell and fin textures, as it enabled intuitive manipulation that would have been difficult with traditional modelling tools alone. 
The tactile feedback also helped us maintain smooth surface continuity while enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the model.    </li>
    
	  <li>
      <strong>3D Printing Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
		  <p>
Once the design was finalised, we used Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printers to fabricate the parts of the manta ray. 
PLA filament was chosen as the primary printing material due to its rigidity, ease of use, and affordability. The model was divided into printable segments, including: 
	  </p>

	<ul>
		<li>The hollow main body
		<li>Left and right segmented pectoral fins
		<li>An optional tail and caudal fin section
		<li>Internal mounts for servo motors and threading mechanisms
	</ul>
	  <p>
		Slicing and print settings were managed using Cura, where we carefully oriented each part to minimise the need for supports and to avoid print failures. 
		The university’s 3D printing workshop provided the necessary infrastructure to monitor prints, make adjustments, and iterate quickly when necessary.</p>  </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Laser Cutting Hardware and Workshop Facilities:</strong><br>
This method allowed us to quickly produce accurate 2D parts, which were then integrated into the 3D assembly. 
The combination of laser-cut and 3D printed parts offered a hybrid fabrication solution that was both efficient and cost-effective.</li>
