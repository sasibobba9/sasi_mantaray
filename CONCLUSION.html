  <p>
The final design of the manta ray-inspired robotic model reflects the successful transformation of a natural marine creature into an engineered, 3D-printed prototype. 
The aim of the project was to replicate both the structure and movement of a real manta ray using bio-inspired design principles combined with modern fabrication techniques.

The manta ray model was developed using accurate anatomical references, which were gathered through 3D scanning of fish models. 
The scanning process helped us to not only understand the complex curves and structure of the manta ray’s body but also capture fine surface details such as skin textures. 
This gave our prototype a more realistic and organic appearance.

The final prototype features a rigid central body shell with large, segmented pectoral fins attached on either side. 
These fins were designed to replicate the unique and graceful fin movements of a real manta ray. 
Rather than using traditional mechanical joints, we created a flexible 3D-printed design connected through fishing thread. 
This thread was controlled with servo motors, enabling the fins to flap smoothly in a controlled motion, closely mimicking the fluid undulation seen in nature.

Our design approach focused on creating a hollow structure for the main body to reduce weight while also providing sufficient internal space to mount electronics such as servo motors and wires. 
The result is a lightweight yet durable model, primarily fabricated using PLA material through FDM 3D printing technology.  </p>

   <h2 class="major">Key Features</h2>							
  <p>
The final manta ray model was designed with several important features that contributed to its realistic movement and visual accuracy:
  </p>
 <li>
      <strong>Realistic Anatomical Structure:</strong><br>	
The overall shape and surface detailing of the manta ray were based on 3D scanning data from fish models and biological references. This allowed us to design a body form that closely matched the curves and patterns of a real manta ray.  </li>

<li>
<strong>Segmented Fin Design for Flexibility:</strong><br>
The pectoral fins were created as segmented parts, allowing them to move naturally without complex mechanical joints. This design, combined with fishing thread and servo control, enabled a smooth and lifelike flapping motion.  </li>

<li>
<strong>Lightweight 3D Printed Parts:</strong><br>	
PLA material was used for most of the printed parts due to its strength and ease of printing. The hollow structure reduced overall weight, making the model easier to handle and improving its movement performance.  </li>

<li>									
<strong>Internal Space for Electronics:</strong><br>							
The main body was designed to include mounting structures for servo motors, allowing easy installation and secure placement of electronics. The internal design also considered wiring paths for neat and protected assembly.  </li>


<li>									
<strong>Fishing Thread Motion Mechanism:</strong><br>
Instead of using heavy or bulky mechanical parts, lightweight fishing thread was used to connect the fins to servo motors. This setup allowed flexible movement, mimicking the organic fin motion of real manta rays.</li>
  </p>
									
  <h2 class="major">Presentation and Testing</h2>
  <p>
Once the final assembly was completed, the manta ray prototype underwent a series of movement tests to evaluate its functionality and visual resemblance. 
Servo motors were installed inside the hollow body, connected to the pectoral fins using fishing thread.

We conducted manual and motorised movement tests to check the performance of the fin articulation. 
The tests confirmed that the fins moved smoothly with a gentle and realistic undulating motion, effectively imitating the gliding behaviour of manta rays in water.

The surface quality, structure, and overall appearance of the prototype were also evaluated.
The anatomical accuracy, fine surface texture captured from the 3D scans, and segmented fins all contributed to a visually engaging and realistic final model.

Videos and photographs were taken during the testing phase to document the design, assembly, and movement performance of the prototype. 
The model was presented as a functional concept for educational purposes and bio-inspired robotic design.
  </p>

  <h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
This project successfully explored the integration of biomimicry and engineering through the development of a 3D-printed, manta ray-inspired robotic model. By combining natural design inspiration with modern digital fabrication tools, 
we were able to produce a prototype that not only looks visually accurate but also replicates the natural movement of manta ray fins.

Throughout the development process, we made use of several advanced resources such as 3D scanning hardware, motion capture technology, Onshape 3D modelling software, and 3D printing facilities. 
Each stage of the project — from capturing anatomical details to assembling the final prototype — contributed to achieving the project's primary objective of creating a functional and lifelike robotic manta ray.

The final model demonstrates the potential of biomimetic design in the field of robotics, particularly in underwater exploration, educational tools, and interactive display models.
The flexibility provided by the fishing thread mechanism combined with servo motor control offers a simple yet effective approach to replicating organic motion.
  </p>

 <h2 class="major">Future Improvements</h2>	
<p>
While the current prototype has met the project’s initial goals, there are several possible future enhancements that could further improve the model: </p>
<ul>
		<li>Full waterproofing and underwater testing to evaluate real-world performance.
		<li>Integration of advanced electronics like sensors or remote control systems for autonomous movement.
		<li>Further refinement of surface textures using resin coating or painting techniques to increase realism.
		<li>Exploration of flexible 3D printing materials like TPU for even smoother fin motion.
		<li>Improving structural durability for longer operation and handling.
